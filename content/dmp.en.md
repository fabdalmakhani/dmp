## the framework

The ways in which we move are highly individual, but every body can move and be moved by dance. You don't need to perform - it's about your individual expression.  
My approach is underpinned by principles of dance movement psychotherapy, attachment theory, developmental psychology, psychodynamic therapy and various movement & somatic practices.

## my offering

I create a safe environment in which feelings can be expressed, contained and worked through. Coming into contact with yourself through movement, new patterns and emotional experiences are able to emerge.

I work with individuals on a 1-1 basis as well as offering groups & workshops.  
Get in touch and we will find what best suits you.
